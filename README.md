## Overview of Order Management System

### Problem Statement Assumption

The problem statement assumes the need for an order management system where internal teams can manage orders by performing actions such as adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving order information. The system should provide a web service API that allows other systems and teams to obtain information about orders.

### Solution Overview

The solution involves building a web service using JavaScript/TypeScript and the Express framework. The data for the system will be stored in a PostgreSQL database. The web service will implement several endpoints that handle POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests. It will also include an endpoint to retrieve all orders.

### Functionality and Endpoints

1. **Add Order**
   - Endpoint: `POST /orders`
   - This endpoint allows the creation of a new order. The request should include the necessary order details such as datetime, totalfee, and services.
   - An internal API key must be provided in the headers for authentication.

2. **Update Order**
   - Endpoint: `PUT /orders/:id`
   - This endpoint allows the update of an existing order. Only orders created 3 hours or more before can be updated.
   - The request should include the updated order details, and the order ID should be specified in the URL.
   - Authentication using the internal API key is required.

3. **Get All Orders**
   - Endpoint: `GET /orders`
   - This endpoint retrieves all the existing orders.
   - Authentication using the internal API key is required.

4. **Get Order by ID**
   - Endpoint: `GET /orders/:id`
   - This endpoint retrieves a specific order based on the provided order ID.
   - The order ID should be specified in the URL.
   - Authentication using the internal API key is required.

5. **Delete Order**
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /orders/:id`
   - This endpoint deletes an existing order based on the provided order ID.
   - The order ID should be specified in the URL.
   - Authentication using the internal API key is required.

### Testing

A test suite has been developed using the Jest testing framework. The test suite includes test cases for each endpoint to ensure the proper functionality of the order management system. The test suite can be executed by running the command `npm run test`.

### Trade-offs and Assumptions

- The solution assumes the use of a PostgreSQL database for storing order data.
- The internal API key is used for authentication to restrict access to the endpoints.
- Error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes are implemented for edge cases and error scenarios.
- The solution focuses on the backend implementation using JavaScript/TypeScript and the Express framework. The frontend user interface is not included.
- The provided sample data for orders and service records can be extended or modified as per the project requirements.

### Potential Improvements for Production

If building this system for production, the following improvements can be considered:

- Implementing additional security measures such as encryption of sensitive data and secure communication protocols (HTTPS).
- Implementing rate limiting and request throttling to protect against abuse and ensure system stability.
- Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to manage user roles and permissions.
- Implementing pagination for retrieving large sets of orders to improve performance.
- Implementing logging and monitoring to track system behavior and detect any issues.
- Implementing input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Implementing automated deployment and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for smoother deployment and testing processes.

### Environment Setup Instructions

To set up the environment to run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository containing the code.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
3. Set

 up the PostgreSQL database and provide the connection details in the `.env` file.
4. Run the command `npm run start` to start the server.
5. Use the provided API endpoints and sample cURL commands to interact with the order management system.

Please note that the provided instructions assume you have the required dependencies, such as Node.js and npm, installed on your system.
